<!-- l. 5 --><p class='noindent'>ngscopeclient is a high performance, GPU accelerated remote user interface, signal processing, protocol
analysis, and automation tool for test and measurement equipment. It runs on all major operating systems
and can interoperate with a broad and continuously growing range of T&amp;M products from many
vendors.
</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class='indent'>   As of this writing, ngscopeclient is under active development but has not had a formal v0.1 release and
should be considered alpha quality.
</p><!-- l. 12 --><p class='indent'>   This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. There is NO WARRANTY, to the

<!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>Numbers are decimal unless explicitly specified otherwise. Binary or hexadecimal values use SystemVerilog
notation, for example ’b10 means the binary value 10 (2) with no length specified, and 8’h41 means the
8-bit hexadecimal value 41 (decimal 65)
</p><!-- l. 21 --><p class='indent'>   When referring to colors, HTML-style #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA notation is used. For example
#ff0000 means pure red with unspecified alpha (assumed fully opaque) and #ff000080 means pure red
with 50% opacity.
</p><!-- l. 24 --><p class='indent'>   Printf-style format codes are used when describing output of protocol decodes. For example, “%02x"
means data is formatted as hexadecimal bytes with leading zeroes.
</p><!-- l. 27 --><p class='indent'>   Items to be selected from a menu are displayed in <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>monospace font</span>.
</p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='indent'>   Multilevel menu paths are separated by a / character. For example, <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Attenuation / 1x </span>means to open
the <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Attenuation </span>submenu and select the <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>1x </span>item.
</p><!-- l. 32 --><p class='indent'>   If there are multiple options for a menu or configuration option, they are displayed in square brackets
and separated by a | character. For example, <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Move waveform to / Waveform Group [1|2]</span>
means to select either <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Waveform Group 1 </span>or <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Waveform Group 2 </span>from the <span class='t1-zi4r-0-x-x-109'>Move waveform to</span>
menu.

<!-- l. 45 --><p class='noindent'>Most UI elements can be interacted with by left clicking (select), left dragging (move), using the scroll
wheel (zoom), double clicking (open properties dialog), or right clicking (context menu). Hovering the
mouse over a main window UI element, or a (?) help marker in a dialog box, displays a tooltip explaining
the purpose of the element
</p><!-- l. 52 --><p class='indent'>   Most text fields allow SI prefixes for scaling values (mV, \(\mu s\), GHz, etc). Lowercase ‘u’ is interpreted as
“micro", equivalent to the Greek letter \(\mu \). The unit is automatically added if not specified, for example
typing “2.4G" in a frequency input field will be interpreted as meaning 2.4 GHz.
</p><!-- l. 56 --><p class='noindent'>

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='design-philosophy'><span class='titlemark'>1.3.2   </span> <a id='x3-70001.3.2'></a>Design Philosophy</h4>
<!-- l. 58 --><p class='noindent'>Users familiar with conventional benchtop oscilloscopes will notice some important distinctions between
ngscopeclient and classical DSO user interfaces. While there is an initial learning curve getting used to the
different ways of doing things, these changes allow for greater productivity and more complex
analysis.
</p><!-- l. 62 --><p class='indent'>   Legacy DSO user interfaces largely still imitate the front panel controls of analog CRT
instruments dating back to the mid 1940s. A single view of each waveform shows the entire
acquisition on a grid with a fixed number of divisions (emulating an etched graticule on a CRT)
and both time and voltage scales are defined in terms of these divisions. While more recent
DSOs do allow math functions, protocol decodes, zooms, and so on, this archaic concept has
remained.
</p><!-- l. 67 --><p class='indent'>   In ngscopeclient, the acquisition record length is completely decoupled from the X axis scale of the
viewport, and there is no concept of a “zoom" waveform or measuring time in “divisions". Arbitrarily
many views of a channel may be created, and each may be scaled and zoomed independently.
Acquisition record length and duration are controlled separately, from the timebase properties
dialog.
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly, vertical scale for waveforms is defined in terms of full-scale range, a far more intuitive and
useful metric than arbitrary “divisions". While horizontal grid lines are still displayed in waveform views
for convenience, their number, spacing, and locations may change. Tall plots will have more scale divisions
than short ones, and the divisions are always located at round numbers even if this requires the grid to not
be centered in the plot (Fig. <a href='#-example-waveform-showing-offcenter-grid-and-roundnumbered-grid-lines'>1.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: y-divs  --></a>)

<!-- l. 84 --><p class='indent'>   Rather than optimizing for a touch screen (as is common for benchtop oscilloscopes), ngscopeclient’s UI
is heavily mouse driven and context based. Space used by always-visible buttons, sliders, etc is kept to a
minimum in order to keep as much screen real estate as possible usable for waveform display. Additional
controls are displayed in menus or pop-up dialogs which can be closed, moved out of view, or docked as
needed.
</p>
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='terminology'><span class='titlemark'>1.3.3   </span> <a id='x3-80001.3.3'></a>Terminology</h4>
<!-- l. 91 --><p class='noindent'>The overall software package consists of <span class='ecti-1095'>ngscopeclient </span>(graphical user interface frontend), <span class='ecti-1095'>libscopehal </span>(C++
library for core APIs and instrument drivers), and <span class='ecti-1095'>libscopeprotocols </span>(filter graph blocks). End users will
normally use ngscopeclient, however it is possible to interface with libscopehal and libscopeprotocols
directly from C++ code for writing low level test automation tools or even a fully custom
application-specific user interface.
</p><!-- l. 96 --><p class='indent'>   Data consists of two fundamental types: <span class='ecti-1095'>scalars </span>and <span class='ecti-1095'>waveforms</span>. A scalar is a single numeric value with
an associated unit, for example “500 mV". A waveform is a sequence of <span class='ecti-1095'>samples </span>plotted against another
quantity, for example voltage versus time for an oscilloscope waveform or amplitude versus frequency for a
spectrum analyzer waveform.
</p><!-- l. 101 --><p class='indent'>   Samples may be of arbitrary type (analog value, digital bit, SPI bus event, etc.), but all samples in a
single waveform must be of the same data type. Waveforms may be either <span class='ecti-1095'>uniform </span>(sampled at constant
rate with no gaps between samples) or <span class='ecti-1095'>sparse </span>(sampled at arbitrary intervals, possibly with gaps between
samples).
</p><!-- l. 105 --><p class='indent'>   An <span class='ecti-1095'>instrument  </span>is a physical piece of hardware
<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn1x2' id='fn1x2-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x3-8001f1'></a> which
can be remote controlled and interacted with. The connection between ngscopeclient and an instrument is
provided by a <span class='ecti-1095'>transport</span>, such as a USBTMC interface, a GPIB data stream, or a TCP socket. A <span class='ecti-1095'>driver </span>is a
software component, either supplied as part of the libscopehal core or a third party plugin, which controls
an instrument.
</p><!-- l. 111 --><p class='indent'>   Each instrument has one or more<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn2x2' id='fn2x2-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x3-8003f2'></a>
<span class='ecti-1095'>channels</span>. A channel corresponds to a single logical “piece" of an instrument and may consist of one or
more physical connectors: a typical oscilloscope channel has a single BNC input while a typical power
supply output has two banana jacks.
</p><!-- l. 116 --><p class='indent'>   Each channel may provide features associated with one or more instrument <span class='ecti-1095'>types</span>, and not all channels
on an instrument are guaranteed to be the same type(s). For example, an oscilloscope may consist of
several channels providing both waveform acquisition (oscilloscope) and scalar acquisition (multimeter)
capabilities, one channel providing only trigger input capability, and one channel providing function
generator output capability.
</p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='indent'>   All channels, triggers, and math / protocol decode blocks are considered <span class='ecti-1095'>nodes </span>within the <span class='ecti-1095'>filter graph</span>.
The filter graph is a directed acyclic graph (a set of nodes and connections between them, with no loops
permitted) connecting all of the various data inputs and outputs of the experimental setup
together.
</p><!-- l. 125 --><p class='indent'>   Each node may have zero or more <span class='ecti-1095'>inputs</span>, of either scalar or waveform type, and zero or more output
<span class='ecti-1095'>streams</span>. A stream is a data source which may or may not have an associated scalar or waveform value; for
example a math block with missing inputs or an instrument which has not yet triggered do not have a
meaningful value. A typical oscilloscope channel might have one waveform output stream, while a typical
power supply channel might have two scalar output streams for measured current and voltage. A sink
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
block for writing a waveform to a CSV file would have one input for each column in the generated
file.
</p><!-- l. 132 --><p class='indent'>   Instrument hardware limitations or the particular math/decode block’s design will impose various
restrictions on legal connections in the filter graph. For example, a trigger can normally only accept signals
from hardware input channels on the same instrument. An FFT filter can only accept uniformly
sampled analog waveforms. A UART protocol decode can only accept digital waveforms, so
analog waveforms must be converted to digital by a thresholding filter before they can be
decoded.
