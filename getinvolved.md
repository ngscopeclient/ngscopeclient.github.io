# Get Involved

## Developer Chat

Want to contribute to the project? We suggest joining the developer chat, which may be accessed via your choice of IRC or Discord:

* IRC webchat: [\#scopehal on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#scopehal) (or [connect with your own client](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/scopehal))
* Discord: [\#scopehal on 1bitsquared](https://discord.gg/URuN2BuGwG)

Both the IRC and Discord channels are bridged so you can talk to everyone using either protocol.
Public logs of the bridged channels can be found [here](https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/scopehal/).

The developer chat is the primary mechanism for active developers to discuss features they're working on, help each other out, and coordinate the overall direction of the project.

We also host developer meetings on Zoom, typically about once per month. Connection and scheduling information is shared in the chat channel.
